Description: A native R implementation of grammatical evolution (GE).
    GE facilitates the discovery of programs that can achieve a desired goal.
    This is done by performing an evolutionary optimisation over a population
    of R expressions generated via a user-defined context-free grammar (CFG)
    and cost function.
